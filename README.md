# YTU OBS Mobile (YTÜ OBS Mobil)

## EN

This app makes it easier to login to YTÜ Student Affairs Information System (OBS) by providing an interface that remembers usernames and passwords. Also, there is a bottom navigation bar that has the mostly used pages (Weekly Schedule, Grades, Announcements, etc.) in the system to make it easier and faster to switch between different pages.

While I was walking quickly to catch up with the lesson, I was having difficulties when I had to log into the system to find out which class the lesson would be in, because I was misclicking and this was slowing me down. In order to prevent this, I developed this application that requires minimum typing and minimum button click. I achieved minimum typing by remembering usernames, passwords and E-Government login information. And by adding a bottom navigation bar that has the mostly used pages, I achieved the minimum click. 

To display the OBS website in my app, I utilized Flutter InAppWebView, and to remember the user's login information, I used Shared Preferences.
