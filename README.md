# YTU Mobile

This app makes it easier to login to YTÃœ Student Information System (OBS) by providing an interface that remembers usernames and passwords. Also, there is a bottom navigation bar that has the mostly used pages (Weekly Schedule, Grades, Announcements, etc.) in the system to make it easier and faster to switch between different pages.
